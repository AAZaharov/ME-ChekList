# ME-ChekList

  What is it?
  -----------
  In the course of my work as a mechanical engineer, this CheckList was created. 
  I present this repository as an example of my projects and development experiences 
  as a complete newbie in the field. This project was developed by me and my colleagues 
  with nothing but enthusiasm, at free time and was aimed at improving the quality 
  of engineers in our department. 
  
  Basic Functions
  -----------
  
  -Creation of template sheets to check the provided work of the engineer 
  -Interactive editing of template sheet items and fields
  -Access to the database of engineers
  -Saving completed template sheets to the .xlsm database
  -Access to database cells with the results of checking the work of engineers
  -Option to send an automatic letter with the results of the check to the 
  engineer of the department
  -Collection of telemetry about the quality of engineers' work in the department
  
  Conclusion
  -----------
  
  This project cannot be regarded as a completely finished product. 
  If only because the sheet template data cannot be provided. 

  But after several years of using this checklist, I can say that I am completely 
  satisfied with my work and proud of the work done.
